# Getting Started with Wasp Language Development

## Introduction to Wasp

Wasp is a revolutionary full-stack web development framework that simplifies the process of building modern web applications by providing a declarative approach to defining your app's core elements.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Declarative Configuration
Wasp uses a unique declarative syntax that allows you to define your entire application's structure in a single `.wasp` configuration file.

```wasp
app MyProject {
  title: "Enterprise Task Management",
  auth: {
    methods: {
      email: {},
      google: {}
    },
    userEntity: User
  }
}
```

### 2. Full-Stack Integration
Wasp seamlessly bridges client-side and server-side development, providing:
- Automatic routing
- Built-in authentication
- Simplified state management
- Integrated database migrations

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of React and Node.js

### Installation

#### 1. Install Wasp CLI
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr https://get.wasp-lang.dev -useb | iex
```

#### 2. Verify Installation
```bash
wasp --version
```

### Project Initialization

#### Create New Project
```bash
# Initialize a new Wasp project
wasp start my-project-name

# Navigate to project directory
cd my-project-name
```

## Core Development Patterns

### 1. Entity Definition
Define your data models using Prisma schema within Wasp:

```wasp
entity User {=psl
  id         Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email      String  @unique
  name       String?
  role       UserRole @default(MEMBER)
=psl}

enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  MANAGER
  MEMBER
}
```

### 2. Server Actions
Create server-side logic with ease:

```wasp
action createUser {
  fn: import { createUser } from "@server/actions.js",
  entities: [User]
}
```

### 3. Routing
Declarative route configuration:

```wasp
route DashboardRoute { 
  path: "/dashboard", 
  component: Dashboard,
  authRequired: true
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Modular Architecture
- Keep components small and focused
- Utilize Wasp's co-location features
- Separate concerns between client and server

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Use server actions for data mutations
- Leverage built-in code splitting
- Minimize client-side state management

### 3. Security Considerations
- Implement role-based access control
- Use built-in authentication methods
- Validate and sanitize user inputs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Dependency conflicts
- Authentication setup
- Database migration problems

### Recommended Tools
- React DevTools
- Prisma Studio
- Wasp VSCode Extension
