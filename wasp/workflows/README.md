# Wasp Workflow Toolkit

> **⚠️ Work in Progress**: 
> - The toolkit contains workflows at various stages of development
> - Workflows within the [Post-Scaffolding Sprint Workflow](sprint/post-scaffolding-sprint-workflow-chain.md) have been most rigorously tested
> - Ongoing development and validation is in progress

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of AI-powered workflows designed specifically for developing applications using the Wasp language. Each workflow is crafted to provide structured guidance across different development phases.

## Core Features

- **Workflow Chains**
  - Structured sequences of connected prompts
  - Input/output dependencies between phases
  - Verification points for workflow integrity
  - Systematic development processes
  - Progress tracking and validation

- **Project Initialization**
  - Requirements generation
  - Scaffolding strategies
  - Full-stack development approach
