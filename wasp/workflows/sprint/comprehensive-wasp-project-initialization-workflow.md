# Comprehensive Wasp Project Initialization Workflow

## ðŸš€ Workflow Overview
A step-by-step, actionable guide for initializing a production-ready Wasp application with comprehensive planning, setup, and validation.

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Initialization Checklist

### 1. Project Conceptualization Phase
- [ ] Define core project objectives
- [ ] Identify target user personas
- [ ] Outline key features and functionalities
- [ ] Assess technical feasibility

#### Reflection Checkpoint 1
> **Project Vision Validation**
> - Have you clearly articulated the problem your application solves?
> - Can you describe your application in one concise paragraph?
> - Have you identified your primary user groups?

### 2. Technical Requirement Assessment

#### 2.1 Technology Stack Compatibility
- [ ] Verify Node.js version (16.x+ recommended)
  ```bash
  node --version
  # Expected output: v16.x.x or higher
  ```

- [ ] Check npm/yarn installation
  ```bash
  npm --version
  # or
  yarn --version
  ```

- [ ] Confirm system requirements for Wasp
  - 64-bit operating system
  - Sufficient RAM (8GB+)
  - Stable internet connection

#### 2.2 Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Wasp CLI
  ```bash
  # macOS/Linux
  curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev | sh

  # Windows (PowerShell)
  iwr https://get.wasp-lang.dev -useb | iex
  ```

- [ ] Verify Wasp installation
  ```bash
  wasp --version
  # Confirm version 0.11.x or compatible
  ```

#### Reflection Checkpoint 2
> **Environment Readiness**
> - Have you confirmed all prerequisite software versions?
> - Is your development environment fully configured?
> - Do you understand the basic Wasp CLI commands?

## 3. Project Initialization

### 3.1 Project Creation
- [ ] Create new Wasp project
  ```bash
  # Initialize project
  wasp start my-project-name
  
  # Navigate to project directory
  cd my-project-name
  ```

### 3.2 Initial Configuration Template
Create a comprehensive `.wasp` configuration file:

```wasp
app MyProjectName {
  title: "Enterprise Project Management Tool",
  
  auth: {
    methods: {
      email: {},
      google: {},
      github: {}
    },
    userEntity: User,
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  }
}

// Core entity definitions
entity User {=psl
  id           Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  email        String    @unique
  name         String
  role         UserRole  @default(MEMBER)
  createdAt    DateTime  @default(now())
=psl}

// Role-based access control
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  MANAGER
  MEMBER
}

// Initial routes
route LoginRoute { 
  path: "/login", 
  component: Login 
}

route DashboardRoute { 
  path: "/dashboard", 
  component: Dashboard,
  authRequired: true
}

// Server actions placeholder
action createUser {
  fn: import { createUser } from "@server/actions.js",
  entities: [User]
}
```

#### Reflection Checkpoint 3
> **Configuration Validation**
> - Have you customized the `.wasp` file for your specific project?
> - Do the initial entities reflect your application's core data model?
> - Have you considered potential future scalability?

## 4. Documentation Development

### 4.1 Project Documentation Template
Create a `PROJECT.md` with comprehensive project details:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: 
- **Target Users**: 
- **Key Features**:

## Technical Specification
- **Wasp Version**: 
- **Primary Technologies**:
  - Frontend: React
  - Backend: Node.js
  - Database: PostgreSQL

## Development Setup
- Prerequisite software
- Installation instructions
- Environment configuration

## Architecture
- High-level system design
- Component interactions
- Data flow diagrams

## Deployment Strategy
- Hosting platforms
- CI/CD pipeline
- Performance considerations
```

### 4.2 Initial README Preparation
- [ ] Create comprehensive `README.md`
- [ ] Include setup instructions
- [ ] Document development workflows

#### Reflection Checkpoint 4
> **Documentation Completeness**
> - Is your project documentation clear and comprehensive?
> - Have you explained the project's purpose and setup?
> - Can a new developer understand the project quickly?

## 5. Development Environment Configuration

### 5.1 Recommended VSCode Extensions
- [ ] Wasp Language Support
- [ ] Prisma
- [ ] ESLint
- [ ] Prettier

### 5.2 Initial Dependencies
- [ ] Install core dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  ```

## 6. Initial Development Workflow

### 6.1 Database Setup
- [ ] Configure database connection
- [ ] Generate initial migrations
  ```bash
  wasp db migrate-dev
  ```

### 6.2 Basic Authentication Flow
- [ ] Implement user registration
- [ ] Create login mechanism
- [ ] Set up role-based access

#### Reflection Checkpoint 5
> **Initial Development Validation**
> - Have you successfully run initial database migrations?
> - Can you authenticate and create basic user flows?
> - Are your initial components functioning?

## 7. Continuous Improvement Plan

### 7.1 Regular Review Checklist
- [ ] Monthly architecture review
- [ ] Quarterly dependency updates
- [ ] Ongoing performance monitoring

## 8. Potential Challenges and Mitigation

### Common Initialization Challenges
1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - Use `npm ci` for consistent installations
   - Regularly update dependencies

2. **Authentication Complexity**
   - Start with email-based authentication
   - Gradually add social login providers

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Monitor initial application load times
   - Implement code splitting
   - Use Wasp's built-in optimization techniques

## 9. Next Steps and Recommendations
- Implement core business logic
- Develop comprehensive test suites
- Set up continuous integration

## Workflow Completion Criteria
